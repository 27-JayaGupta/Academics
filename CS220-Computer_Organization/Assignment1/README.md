1. Write a Verilog code module to implement one-bit full adder. Write
   another module to implement eight-bit ripple carry adder that instantiates
   eight one-bit full adders and connects them properly. Now, add a test
   bench to test the eight-bit ripple carry adder.
   Write a test bench to test the eight-bit adder. Make sure to display your
   inputs, sum, and carry out. Your test bench must have fifteen different
   inputs. Put five-time unit delay between consecutive inputs. Place one
   module in one Verilog file i.e., you will have three Verilog files.

2. Write a Verilog code to implement an eight-bit comparator using eight
   one-bit comparators. Follow the similar nomenclature as discussed in
   question 1. Your test bench must have fifteen different inputs. Put
   five-time unit delay between consecutive inputs. Place one module in one
   Verilog file i.e., you will have three Verilog files.

3. Write a Verilog code to implement a two-to-four decoder. Then a top
   module for three-to-eight decoder using two-to-four decoder. Write a test
   bench to test three-to eight decoder for all possible input with five-time
   delay.

4. write a Verilog code to implement an 8-to-3 priority encoder where
   priority is given to the least significant input position with a 1. For
   example, if the input is 11000000, the output would be 110 encoding the
   position of the least significant 1 in the input (leftmost bit is the most
   significant bit). Write a test bench to test encoder for at least five
   test cases. Put five-time unit delay between consecutive inputs.
