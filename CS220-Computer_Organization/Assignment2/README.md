1. Write detailed description of Carry Look-Ahead Adder and its working with the proper circuit diagram in a PDF file. Then write the Verilog code module to implement Carry Look-Ahead Adder. Now, add a test bench to test the Carry Look-Ahead Adder. Make sure to display your inputs, sum, and carry out. Your test bench must have fifteen different inputs. Put five-time unit delay between consecutive inputs.

2. Write detailed description of 8-bit Johnson Counter and its working with the proper circuit diagram and truth table in a PDF file. Then write the Verilog code module to implement 8-bit Johnson Counter. Now, add a test bench to test all the states of the 8-bit Johnson Counter.
