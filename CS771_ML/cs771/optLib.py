# The word "oracle", as used below, refers for a function that does a certain job to our satisfaction.
# For example, our step length oracle returns a step length value whenever we ask it, the gradient
# oracle always returns a direction either by calculating the gradient, or the (mini-batch) stochastic gradient

# Get functions that offer various step length sequences. The constant step length scheme is only suitable for
# "superbly nice" functions that satisfy two properties known as "strong convexity" and "strong smoothness". 
# The quadratic scheme decreases step lengths gradually and is a good choice for several cases, whether "nice" or not.
# The linear scheme decreases step lengths fairly rapidly and is suitable for functions with intermediate "niceness".
# Examples include strongly convex functions that are not strongly smooth (the CSVM objective is one such example) or
# strongly smooth functions that are not strongly convex.
